 relied heavily on the mathematics to make sense of physics concepts, 
but then I started to let go and look at the bigger picture of problems 
we were being asked. I found more success when I used my real world 
experience and personal logic to reason with physics, which this course 
really emphasized more so than doing the mathematics.</td>

 this class, I can write a whole essay. I know some of my friends were 
doing better than me, but still loved this class. The first exam, I was 
almost about to get below 50% on midterm. This brought disappointment 
about my grade that I would fail as most of my friends. It really has 
bunch of work and more content to understand, which developed more. 
However, Once professor David said, "I want you to experience more 
confusion." Back on the canvas, their was no more grades tracking. I 
know I have doing bad, but I would rather appreciate, on how he 
developed mind about physics, far ahead from ahead from grade, but to 
acquire knowledge from development of confusion. He must have been doing
 research about students developing confusions and having straight 
forward solutions, which was an interesting topic for me, and always 
raised hands to sort out my confusion. Unfortunately, I developed more 
of them. I don't know if that set it to be a successful research or 
other topic to explore. As I said, I appreciate Professor David for his 
efforts, and making physics bit harder for me to grow.</td>

 course changed the way that I thought about physics. I always thought 
physics was just a subject where you solely used equations and formulas 
to arrive at numerical answers. However, after taking this course, I 
realized physics is so much more than just math and numbers. Physics is a
 way of describing the universe through mathematics, observation, 
refining your everyday thinking. Many problems in physics can be solved 
using simple observation and life experiences, not just math. The math 
can even help to clarify those observations or to strengthen the 
conclusion made from those observations. Also, this course has taught me
 that it is okay to be wrong. Scientists are constantly wrong, and it is
 the pursuit of the making sense of the world due to the confusion and 
errors that makes science what it is. It was one of the most challenging
 courses I have ever taken, but I have also learned the most in this 
course. Although I still need more time to be fully comfortable with my 
confusion, this course has definitely gave me a comfortable place to 
start. I have applied things that I have learned, such as sense making, 
everyday thinking, and explaining concepts in simple terms, in this 
course into all aspects of my life. People understand me better, and I'm
 better able to communicate my confusion. I'm very grateful to have 
taken this course.</td>

 follow up questions that we would get during class really helped me 
pull the strings in my mind and try to understand the concepts that we 
were reviewing in class. This usually happened when David would give us a
 problem that we knew how to solve, and change an element of it, making 
it feel completely new. This class also forced me to look at physics 
through a new, non–mathematical lens.</td>

 was always so annoying to me because a lot of physics problems can be

confusion in words and think through every possible solution. While at 
first I was reluctant and just wanted to plug and chug with numbers, I 
will admit that having the liberty to explore many different

 hours helped me the most with my learning in this course. The ability 
to discuss with other students about problems and confusions that I had 
helped me reconcile so many concepts. Also, everyone has different life 
experiences, so our everyday thinking may differ from one another. I 
loved that the students in office hours were so willing to collaborate. I
 also loved that the course staff encouraged collaboration. Being able 
to solve problems and deduce the reasonings become much more fun when it
 is being done with other people. Furthermore, I love the real–world 
examples that were being done in class. It really emphasized the "use 
and refine everyday thinking" aspect of the course. Being able to 
visualize a concept makes it easier to understand. Also, discussing with
 other people in lecture about different problems was extremely useful 
and interesting.</td>

 for this result, but I honestly wish he provided a more definitive 
summary at the end of each problem or even class of the answers to some

 think I would have appreciated discussing the problem set more because 
the problem set solutions sometimes confused me.  I also would have 
liked to do some more multiple choice physics problems, such as ones 
similar to those given on the exams, because when it came to the exams I
 had a pretty tough time with them. I think often we spent too long on 
problems in lecture. I did appreciate how discussion was a priority in 
class, but I often felt confused and unsure of answers to problems we

answers, but with questions instead, but I often felt confused in class.

 MORE ACHIEVE VIDEOS. Achieve videos are fast paced, wordy, and uses too
 much math. Although I understand that physics requires a lot of math, 
Achieve does math in a way that makes it impossible to understand. The 
variables are moved too fast, and the explanations are so wordy that I 
spend more time trying to understand what the person is saying rather 
than what is happening on the screen. Also, a lot of what is used in the
 Achieve videos do not help with the conceptual understanding of physics
 that is emphasized in this course. There are much better videos that 
can be found on Youtube that can explain the concepts 10 times better 
than Achieve videos. One thing I did like about Achieve were the bridge 
questions. They really engaged my thinking, and I was always excited to 
see what my peers thought about the questions the next day. It made me 
think, "What do I think about this problem, and what would others think 
about this problem?". They also helped me pinpoint where my confusion 
resided. In conclusion, I think the bridge questions on Achieve were 
helpful, but not the videos.</td>

 David's whole motto is that he wants us to express our confusion as 
explicitly as we can, in order to get the most our of our learning. He 
doesn't always care about the right answer, but rather the methods used 
to obtain and achieve it. Essentially he wants to see us "learn" and 
reflect on our learning. He told me that tests were not as important and
 that he just wanted to use them so that we could track our learning 
through it. However, I find that the multiple choice portions of his 
tests kind of contradict what he's been teaching us all year long. 
Without any space to explain our thinking and show our work, there is no
 way for him (or anybody) to understand why someone came to the answer 
that they did. After all, there is a chance that the person was thinking
 about the problem completely right, and made errors during that process
 that don't necessarily reflect their understanding. How can one even 
determine or know that? For all David knows, if a student gets a couple 
MCQ wrong, they simply just don't understand that topic. Almost every 
student experiences doubt between MCQ answer choices. By providing no 
option for students to explain their work, there is no way for him to 
know if a student was in a (completely valid) indecisive stage between 2
 choices that would have made sense if they explained it. <br><br>Of 
course, I understand that one of the pushbacks for something like this 
is the limited time that we have during tests. However, I feel like a 
model like this would make time less of a problem. With students less 
worried about the right answer, they will spend less time focusing on 
the past and trying to wrack their brain for ideas, and more time 
putting their initial thoughts on paper. With less stress of "needing" 
to get the right answer, they can approach the problems more quickly 
than they probably would have the first time around.</td>

 I agree it is really important for people to understand the actual, 
real–world functioning behind equations and more abstract ideas of

the class structure was combined more with the traditional ways that 
physics and STEM is usually taught in a balance. This is because I think
 it may be difficult for many to adjust to this kind of class after 
having been in classes their whole life that follow a different 
structure and so some people may never fully understand how to do well 
in the course, impacting their ability to really learn the material 
being taught.  I feel like this is exemplified in the consistently low 
average exam scores of the students, which seem to indicate that they 
may not be learning the content too well, so I think it might really 
help to try to modify the class structure to be less foreign to students
 especially considering this is an introductory course. I agree that 
embracing confusion can definitely be a good thing, especially in the 
field, but there's a lot on the line for students and many can't afford 
to be confused because mistakes and uncertainty can cost them dearly. We
 have also been conditioned to avoid being confused or seeming confused

it. However not everyone can teach like him. The LAs tried to help but 
they were never allowed to tell me yes. The closest I ever got was "that
 seems right to me." That is not helpful. After doing all of the work 
and trying to improve all I need is someone to either tell me I am right
 or tell me I am wrong. And if I am wrong  have sat with my confusion 
long enough I need someone to explain where I am wrong and how to fix it
 so I do not make the same mistake again. It is not helpful to tell me 
my thinking is right but my answer is wrong but never give me a reason 
why. Even when I was stuck no one would help. Especially my recitation 
TA. A lovely person but would simply repeat what I said and asked if 
that is what I meant. Half the time I did not know what I met and other 
times I was so stuck that it just annoyed me more. I understand the 
goals of this class but there has to be a better way to help students 
learn. My biggest suggestion is to stop implementing the teaching 
philosophy to people who clearly do not understand it, the LAs and the 
TAs, and to get rid of flip classroom. If you decide to keep the flip 
classroom you should at least explain the questions afterwards. 
Sometimes a student would answer the question correctly and then the 
professor would just be like very good, thats right. But half the time 
when other students spoke I could not follow what they were saying. It 
often was a very math based answer and I do not understand the math 
behind it. Also on that note, the goal of the class was to understand 
physics conceptually however the tests were all math based. That should

 think some of the lectures ended up being more productive than others. 
Time is of course limited in recitations and lectures. I think when only
 2–3 students responded to a question at a time it was most productive 
because we spent more time really understanding their individual 
perspectives and had time to reconcile them.  I feel that we get ample 
student interaction when doing the problem sets and in office hours. I 
think if we could spend more time listening to the professor reconciling
 the a few students' answers at a time that would help lecture be more 
useful. (Of course, listening the professor explain the answer does NOT 
replace our own sense making but helps us clarify other's perspectives).
 Sometimes when a lot of students have input, we have to bounce between 
multiple ideas and the discussion often gets muddled. <br><br>Grades are
 interesting because we are typically assessed on our accuracy only and 
our individual thinking gets little to no credit. I appreciate how the 
course tries to award credit for being able to explain our confusion 
specifically and our general thought process. I do agree that accuracy 
should be awarded as well because at the end of the day, that is 
important. I just wonder if our grade can be more balanced between 
accuracy and effort (working through problems, sense making, etc). I 
wonder if it would be possible to reduce the percentage that exams in 
general  count for or replace a couple accuracy questions with short 
answer questions to reward effort. <br><br>I also understand how grades 
can be a source of stress for some students. I am also aware and 
appreciate that our grade is semi flexible where you account for things 
like in class participation, note taking, improvements between exams, 
etc. However, it can be difficult for some students to not see their 
grade. As you said, we all have to make choices and that also applies 
across classes. In a perfect world I'd be able to spend ample time on 
each subject but I cannot. For example, if a student is trying to 
prioritize studying for finals, they might try to put more effort into 
the class where they are close to achieving an A or just a better grade.
 However, in this course we are unsure of the state of our grade so it 
is difficult to know how much to prioritize this course or not. Maybe 
there can be a way for students to inquire about the state of their 
grade during the course if they choose.</td>

 do not think this course's structure was effective for me as a learner.
 While the method of discussion and grappling with difficult topics 
worked with some concepts, I often found myself grappling with the 
skills needed to approach problems rather than the problems themselves. 
This structure was  especially difficult when it came to studying 
material already covered in the course. It was often difficult to know 
where I would run into trouble on tests and problem sets. Traditional 
lectures are  more easily translated into notes and, when studying, I 
always review my notes which helps me find the gaps in my knowledge.</td>

 I really appreciate about this course is the ability and encouragement 
to make sense of things, especially those that don't come naturally to 
me. While this is something I truly agree is valuable, it's harder to do
 this when you're still being graded on exams. I personally think it's 
more helpful to have a project or a take–home exam instead of a timed 
one. I find this more helpful because I'm not entirely constrained by 
time to articulate my thoughts, but also making it a project/take home 
encourages collaboration, which can be beneficial to those that really 
struggle with grasping the topic. Another thing that I'd appreciate 
having is a solid answer to a problem. I get that not having an answer 
to the problem is common in the real world, but I don't think it's 
helpful because if the students don't know what the correct answer is 
then it's harder for us to prep for the exam.</td>

now, because while it does help to be confused about things at times, we
 also just end up with a lot of gaps in our knowledge which I don't

 don't know exactly how I would change it, but the flipped classroom

 a flipped classroom is just really difficult for me. As much as I'm 
against it, it worked more for this class than it has for others in the 
past, but I wish things would be taught in class rather than outside 
because I didn't understand anything from the Achieve videos until I 
came to class anyway. The other thing that began to frustrate me was 
feedback on the problem sets. I know you are already asking a lot of the
 TAs and I don't blame mine at all for this, but after about the 5th 
problem set, I stopped getting comments altogether and was told that my 
work could not be commented on for time purposes. That made it difficult
 to know exactly what I was doing wrong and became something I was 
frustrated with because my grades on the problem sets didn't reflect 
what I actually needed to review. Even when I reviewed the problem sets,
 I didn't know if my way of thinking about it differently was valid 
because I received no feedback. I know they are working hard. I want to 
make it very clear I don't blame my TA, but if part of the assignment is
 explaining our thinking it's frustrating to feel penalized for doing 
that since it meant my problem sets were too long to actually be 
thoroughly read.</td>

 Hammer is an excellent professor. He challenges the systems of

emphasizes the students' learning for the sake of understanding and 
making sense of the material rather than for grades. Physics is a 
challenging course. and I think that he does an amazing job at teaching 
it. I think that Professor Hammer's course is extremely valuable because
 it teaches students that they are not going to get perfect scores or 
flawless answers all the time. If they are to be scientists, they will 
probably be wrong more times than they are right.  I am really grateful

 Professor Hammer's philosophy about teaching and learning was very

 think David is a nice professor but in his attempts to be nice, he 
sometimes make students feel dumb. He advocates for sitting with 
confusion, even on tests, but the criteria for confusion and what is 
good confusion are iffy. Why should some people get points for confusion
 while others don't? I think he should also implement communicating more
 via announcements as many students have Piazza for many classes and 
working to find instructor notes takes more time than actually thinking 
of the content. Additionally, if he knows the pre–lecture videos aren't 
working, change them. Please. He also withholds certain information? He 
doesn't tell right answers and he's aware people are ticked off by this 
but he wants you to work towards the answer and while I understand, it 
takes away from the course. There is not even the opportunity to use the
 answer to back petal and make sure your approach is correct. 
Additionally, if you are doing the problem wrong but don't recognize 
that, what is the point. Answers for tests and problem sets are unclear 
and the wording of questions is also unclear at points.</td>

 is welcoming and inclusive, I love he encourages to be confident about 
confusion. He is a very nice person, no doubt. However, this format does
 not really work with exams, if he really cared about learning only then
 maybe we should not have those exams, there can be other ways to test 
our understanding or to make them test our abilities better. I was 
confused with his teaching philosophy about being okay with confusion 
and improvement is important but then also giving us exams where most of
 us were not getting high marks which indicate level of understanding. I
 like he is lenient with exam grading and gives lots of points, but they
 were not really fair assessments in my opinion. Grading criteria is so 
unclear too. I love to learn but at the end of the day I am a student 
and grades are important to me too, I wish the class were more 
structured. But again, David is a great instructor and I really 
appreciate him, I just wish the course was structured better.</td>

 Hammer was engaging – he did many in–person demonstrations to help us

 that he emphasized learning I found it rather counterintuitive that in 
the MCQ sections on exams we did not get a chance to explain our 
reasoning and that the grading of exams was so skewed. In theory, 
Professor Hammer's teaching goals were great – but he did not provide us
 with the tools necessary to meet them; for instance, most of my time on
 problem sets was spent not knowing how to start – which he never

 is clearly very enthusiastic about getting us to learn and understand 
physics but the way the class was structured did not work well for me. I
 usually understood his explanations when he gave a concrete right/wrong

 instructor wanted us to figure out concepts for ourselves, but I think 
he took this idea a little too far. It created the impression that we 
were supposed to figure out the concepts on our own, instead of asking 
the instructor for help. This emphasis on "grappling" or "doing physics"
 also distorted what the goal of the problem sets and exams were. It 
seemed like the goal of the problem sets was just to write down as much 
information as possible; write down every though that enters my head as 
I'm thinking about the problem, instead of focusing on how to actually 
do the problem.</td>

 get bad grades and his class but learn from it does not take away from

because we need to get into masters programs to get the jobs we want, so
 we need a good GPA, and that anxiety is reasonable because this is why

 fault, but I feel like he could have been a lot more supportive, and

 know my answers to the ratings might make it seem like David was not 
that great of an instructor, but I don't think those capture what David 
is trying to do and why it is working. There were definitely times when I
 was frustrated. It didn't feel like I was learning anything from the 
achieve prelectures, and coming to class just left me more confused 
because it felt like the explanation was just not working for me, but I 
think that is the whole point. I have so much respect for David and what
 he is trying (and being successful) to do.  I've always felt frustrated
 by the longing to understand why things are happening in classes. David
 starts with that, and builds our understanding from there. I want this 
to work for me so badly, and in many ways it does, but I think something
 about the structure of this class is a little bit off and hindered me 
from actually enjoying it fully. I believe a lot of that is simply 
trying to work within the confines of a system that is built for a 
different way of teaching, and me being so accustomed to that old way of
 learning that this feels frustrating even though it's more fulfilling. 
Even as someone with no interest in pursuing physics as a part of my 
career, I think that David helped me feel like what I was learning was 
meaningful and had significance beyond being a prerequisite, and I have a
 lot of respect for him.</td>

 before the first exam I realized that I was too focused on the 
equations and not the actual thought process of Physics. I then was able
 to change my thinking and it really helped me succeed in the last two 
thirds of the class. For example I was getting 70's on the first few 
problem sets and after I changed my thinking I was getting 100's or only
 one point off.</td>

 way that I changed my approach to learning is that I became more 
comfortable with my confusion. It became easier and easier for me to sit
 with difficult problems and really try to explain what I was confused 
on. I am still working on this, but I am becoming more comfortable with 
not getting the right answer. Furthermore, I became a better 
problem–solver because I began to look at problems from multiple 
different perspectives.  I learned to use my everyday thinking to solve 
difficult problems. Over the semester, my views on learning changed as 
well. Learning is not being able to use an equation or formula to solve a
 repetitive, similarly structured problem. Learning is being able to 
make sense of the material and then apply to more complex problems or 
even simple everyday tasks. It is the ability to take in information, 
make sense of it, and explain it in a way that makes sense to others in 
simpler terms.</td>

 into the course with the intention to learn and improve my thinking,

 bring up the fact that at the end of the day, this is a college class. 
We are all taking it for a grade and there is no way that we can ever 
change or forget that fact. So no matter how hard we try, there will 
always be that pressure to get the question "right", especially since a 
lot of us want to go into med or grad school.</td>

 it sticks, but it enables me to pinpoint the concepts I need to work

 focused on explaining things in terms of  math and formulas as well as 
dimensional analysis, so I was already hardwired to that approach coming

 know I will probably not get an A in this course but I have come into 
acceptance, because this class was hard in that it pushed me to actually
 think about why the concepts worked rather than just memorizing them 
and taking them as fact. I did enjoy class discussions and some of the 
confusion that came along with it and it was very interesting to see how
 explanations could be reconciled with, even if they were wrong. There 
was a thrill in the learning process, which was very different than my 
AP physics experience which essentially taught us how to take the test 
(which itself was very math based) rather than our learning. So I liked 
the learning aspect of this course, but I wish less weight of the grade 
was determined by the test. Maybe they should just serve as checkpoints,
 kinda like the problemsets, or be take–home, since that gets rid of the
 time–induced stress and instead allows for us to think more clearly.</td>

that using equations wouldn't cut it, and I needed to fully explain my

of reasoning, and figure out which is right. We had to get comfortable 
with thinking through wrong answers, and focused on the process of 
getting the answer and why, rather than just plugging into equations. I 
have found this to be very helpful, and even find myself explaining my

 never really had a class that approached learning like this before, so 
it was a very new (and kind of overwhelming/scary) experience for me. It
 really challenged me to accept that confusion is part of the learning 
process – my problem sets included related questions, confusion, and 
sometimes didn't even reach a single answer for a given question.  I'm 
also not used to thinking of several approaches to solving the same 
question, so trying to figure out / discuss multiple perspectives and 
then reconcile any differences between them was not something I had a

Even trying to understand what exactly that confused me was sometimes

confused and then putting in work to get less confused is what learning 
can be.</td>

class, like actually...and I like the idea of being able to express 
confusion and have that be an acceptable answer for questions I don't 
know how to answer because that gives me an opportunity to learn a 
concept deeper, but I just found it really difficult for me to 
understand anything. Like I can keep expressing confusion, but it just 
didn't feel like there was much to help me understand those confusions. 
 I've also never been so convinced that by engaging with that learning I
 would be able to do well in the class, while I did learn to "embrace 
the confusion" a little more I just found it really difficult to learn 
the physics concepts and do well in the course. I feel beginning of the

still true, but now I feel more prepared, not so much in understanding 
physics but being able to handle confusions and be okay with being

 most of my academic life, I succeeded less by understanding the

intentions but just that I never really understood what it meant to 
really engage with the material and to understand as oppose to know some
 fact . I was becoming very frustrated with my academic experience 
because I couldn't really say how much I understood or if my thinking 
had improved in anyway. I believe this course taught me how to learn

being in this course for a semester. It can be frustrating being in a

 think the problem sets were the clearest example of this for me. In 
other classes problem sets are graded on whether or not you got the 
correct answer but in this class it was also based on your logic and 
explanation of your reasoning. By the end of the semester I was 
approaching the problem set questions very differently than I had 
initially. I would first think about the problem purely conceptually and
 see if logic and my "gut feeling" about the answer made sense. Then

 think traditional schooling does teach students to "memorize" topics 
rather than understand concepts. It seems somewhat inevitable when 
grades are at the forefront of many students minds and can determine a 
lot about their future. I was personally aware that in certain subjects,
 I would take the easier way out by memorizing without understanding 
because I was rewarded for my accuracy only and less about my thought 
process. <br><br>I appreciated that this class gave me an opportunity to
 work on my understanding and wrestle with my confusion. Prior to this 
course, I did value the ability to ask specific questions and really 
related to the need for students to understand what confuses them. It's 
easy for students to say they are unsure and ask for the answer. I knew 
that working through the problem would help me understand it better. I 
used to teach students in my sport and knew that a sign of understanding
 was if you could explain the concept to someone else and get them to 
understand it. I practiced these techniques prior to this course but 
never at such an extreme level.<br><br>Some things that have changed my 
approach to learning is being able to explain a concept in multiple 
ways. I was able to seek other perspectives from students and also come 
up with multiple of my own explanations. Most people, including myself, 
typically think about our confusions in our head. However, physically 
writing out a confusion was an invaluable skill I practiced in this 
course. It benefits me as a student to narrow down what I specifically 
do and don't know. It lead me to asking better questions to clarify 
topics. It is also beneficial to my professor/TAs to see my reasoning 
and logic. <br><br>I think the reality is that our academic performance 
will continue to play a major role in our future for grad 
school/employment etc at least in the near future. Balance in college is
 important and sometimes you can't spend all your time on one subject. I
 think most students take the easier way out to maximize their time, 
grades, and overall efficiency. However, I think there must be a better 
way to maximize and balance my life that includes a more thorough 
understanding of the concepts I learn. I think that pure curiosity can 
be a valuable skill in my future where I can be a better problem solver.</td>

 always preferred more practical concepts and applications than textbook
 concepts used in the classroom. I had only taken one physics class 
before during high school and I hated it. We pretty much only used 
equations and it was graded very harshly such as one lab where we had to
 roll a marble off a table and onto half of an index card. We had only 
one attempt and if we failed, we automatically got a C for the lab. 
Though it was definitely pretty bumpy as my grade shows, I loved how 
this class took a far mor hands–on approach, using lectures and labs 
together to provide us with more permanent, useable knowledge. This was 
the first class in a really long time that allowed me to enjoy learning

 think this course has definitely made me shift from one approach to 
another. In the beginning, I went from watching lectures and taking 
notes; however, these did not prove helpful in understanding the concept
 to the degree that I could apply it during the exam. Now, I have 
shifted over to watching shorter lectures online and doing many practice
 problems of all kinds to have a better understanding of how to apply 
the material from class. Going from humanities classes to science–based 
classes, I realized they also require different studying styles.</td>

 actually loved physics before this and now I'm dreading taking physics 
12 because y'all do not care to accommodate. I came to staff and said I 
was struggling because of my autism and the only thing I was told was 
that "being neurodivergent isn't a bad thing". I KNOW it isn't a bad 
thing – but I'm telling you how it negative affected me. Telling me it 
isn't a problem doesn't help when I'm asking for help sense–making 
because I don't understand. And when you say things in class like "if 
you aren't thinking about it like this you're not thinking right". How 
do you think that feels for someone who is genuinely trying there 
hardest but is struggling to understand what you want. Please don't 
dismiss neurodivergent struggles just because it's not a bad thing to be
 autistic. I would have been happy to talk about this more with you, but
 you were dismissive.</td>

 actually had a couple of classes in high school that had a similar 
format to this course where it was discussion based, so I didn't feel 
like my approach to learning changed much there. But, in general, I 
think I learned to be much more comfortable with not knowing something, 
and allowed myself to be ok with not understanding something and having 
questions/being confused. I also learned to not just learn things in 
class in a bubble, but rather, try to find examples of it in the world 
around me.</td>

 came into this class slightly dreading it because in highschool it was 
more derivations and math–based physics however over the course of the 
semester, embracing and settling with my confusion has made me like 
physics a bit more. I liked how by the end of the semestern I was able 
to use multiple ways of solving a problem and figuring out how they 
should all result into the same answer.</td>

 the beginning of the semester, I was definitely using a lot of maths to
 do physics, and this certainly wasn't the best way to go about it. I 
found out that because of that method, there was a lot of stuff that I 
didn't really understand at all, and when things got harder, my brain 
gave up. What changed over the semester is really understand where my 
intuition or thought–process goes wrong, and understanding how to tweak 
it and make sense using the stuff I'm learning in lecture. It's also 
super helpful to talk with friends abt the problem bc hearing it from 
different perspectives allow me to see if I agree or disagree with their
 argument and why</td>

 the class only works in certain situations.</td>

 don't really think I changed anything, I just kind of got over the hump
 of being annoyed at the lack of answers being given and just accepted 
that if I am wrong I don't really always have to blame myself because 
that's just the way I thought. I just kind of did what I had to do and 
that was that. I am a little concerned at the fact that I did much worse
 on the second test while the average stayed the same. So actually 
somehow I think I got less smart over the course, because I started 
understanding less and less and needed more and more help on problem 
sets. So hopefully I can figure that out before the final</td>
