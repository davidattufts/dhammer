                    Building consensus through modeling: A framework for
                    the fitness of ideas in classroom science discourse<br>
                    <small><br>
                      Scientists use argumentation, critique, and
                      modeling to generate consensus around particular
                      ideas. Students in science classrooms can be
                      supported to engage in similar knowledge-building
                      discourses, but how they reach consensus remains
                      underexplored. Drawing from memetics, I take a
                      genetic perspective to present the Idea Fitness
                      Framework (IFF), which identifies four selection
                      forces: Relatedness, Disciplinary Utility,
                      Authority, and Generative Ambiguity, that
                      contribute to an idea’s fitness in student
                      modeling discourses. Using micro genetic and
                      sociogenetic examples of how the forces operate in
                      the classroom, this presentation shows how IFF
                      operates as a dynamic system that helps to explain
                      how consensus is reached in knowledge building
                      discourses.<br>

                    Responsive Teaching Professional Development for
                    Biology Graduate Student Teaching Assistants<br>
                    <small><br>
                      Responsive teaching utilizes any from a variety of
                      approaches that emphasize teachers eliciting,
                      noticing, attending and responding to student
                      thinking and ideas. Teaching responsively can push
                      students to engage more deeply with content and to
                      develop disciplinary practices in an authentic
                      setting of ‘doing science.’My ultimate goal is to
                      design professional development in responsive
                      teaching for graduate student teaching assistants
                      (GTAs) in biological science, and to study their
                      learning. In this talk, I will show data from an
                      introductory biology laboratory that highlights
                      the benefits and challenges of responsive
                      teaching. Drawing from this clip, I will lay out a
                      draft design of the professional development and
                      study, and I will ask for feedback, particularly
                      with respect to data collection.<br>

                    Beyond “asking questions”: problematizing as a
                    disciplinary activity”<br>
                    <br>
                    <small>While problem solving and constructing
                      explanations are widely recognized as important
                      activities within science classrooms, much less
                      attention has been given to the importance of
                      students’ articulating precise problems and
                      constructing clear questions. I argue that
                      well-defined problems are a form of knowledge in
                      science. Therefore, the work of creating and
                      refining these problems--an activity I refer to as
                      problematizing--is an important scientific
                      activity that students should engage in. I address
                      how questions are currently portrayed within the
                      Next Generation Science Standards and conclude
                      with suggestions for how future standards could
                      more accurately reflect the nature of questions
                      and problems in science and better support
                      students’ problematizing in classrooms. <br>

                    Learning About Engineering Design and Physics by
                    Building Musical Instruments<br>
                    <br>
                    <small>Music provides a unique topic for researching
                      maker education because it allows for engagement
                      at varying levels of complexity and different
                      fields of study. The concept that students can
                      learn effectively by creating a physical or
                      digital artifact to try and solve an open ended
                      problem has grown in popularity in the academic
                      community and schools, especially as digital and
                      rapid prototyping tools become more accessible,
                      both in price and user interfaces. The provocation
                      "design and build a musical instrument" can be
                      approached using cardboard and rubber bands or
                      electronics and computer coding, and lends itself
                      to learning about engineering design (the
                      instrument's structurally stability and human
                      factors) as well as about the physics of
                      vibrations (the quality of the sound being
                      produced). I will present past research done
                      during Billund Builds Music, a week long
                      intervention involving 4,000 students in 10
                      schools in Denmark, then share new ideas for
                      students' instrument making and researchers'
                      methodologies as I begin a study on this topic. <br>

                    'Secondary Listening': Students Listening for Their
                    Group Mates' Framing<br>
                    <br>
                    <small>Previous research has indicated the large
                      effect student discourse plays in affecting the
                      success of student groups. We build on this
                      literature by presenting a different focus: While
                      many studies have made progress looking at the
                      content of the speaker’s words to another student
                      (e.g. level of elaboration in an explanation), we
                      study the speaker’s words and behavior for
                      evidence of attention to the audience. We propose
                      that this listening by a speaker happens along
                      multiple dimensions, including what we call
                      ‘secondary listening’ to the implicit messages by
                      their peers about how they are framing the
                      interaction. In this talk, I draw on data from
                      CodeR4Stats, a project to infuse computing into
                      high school statistics using the R programming
                      language. I show evidence of a speaker’s secondary
                      listening as contributing to the one pair’s
                      successful collaboration. <br>
